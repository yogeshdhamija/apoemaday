    You think me so enlightened
    For seeing light where you see dark

    For being hopeful and not frightened 
    Of the paths we will embark

    Enlightened I am, more than a bit
    But not in the way you think

    Rather like when a candle is lit, 
    it goes and enlightens the room.

    You see, when we look out into space, 
    You, the sun and I, the fool

    The sun would see only darkness
    All I see is brilliant blue.
