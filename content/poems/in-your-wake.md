    I picked a flower you had left in your wake
    As I'd done, every day, for months

    I smiled in the light and, always the fool
    I thought I'd come give it to you

    A fraud, I yelled and hooted and fawned
    and finally just stood slack jawed

    As I gave you your own peony. 
    
    If only I could grow my own, and give you two
    I'm glad you liked it anyway.
