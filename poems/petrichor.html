            "Petrichor"

    I say petrichor
    If it's asked for
    A lie, stolen from TV
    For fear of being weird
    
    The smell of dust after rain
     
    But when your head's tucked down low
    And your eyes are on some code
    When I come and kiss your head
    To ask if you're comfy on the bed
    
    When you smile at me then
    It's your hair
    That's really my favorite smell
