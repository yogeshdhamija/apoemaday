             "Two Paces Away"

Two paces away
the green shore lies
warm water, rippling waves
and gold flecks in her eyes

Two paces away
the tree rooted deep
with a brown weathered trunk
yearns for her in his sleep

Two paces away
an infinity it may as well be
but for her breeze-carried spray
that watered the roots of the tree

Two paces away 
this brown banyan tree 
holds her in tight embrace.
Roots, his arms, now hanging down from 
    his large, grown canopy
