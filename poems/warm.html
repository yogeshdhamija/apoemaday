             "Warm"

The table is set
Spread with food
Lit candles, wine-and-coke
And tablecloth swept clean for you

The music is playing
A soft mellow tune
The words unknown, a strum, a tone
And the melody is saying to marry you

The plants are watered
The lights are dim
I've swept the floors
And all is prim

The room is cold
My body is too
I pour my heart
And all my soul
To make enough heat
To keep the room warm for you
