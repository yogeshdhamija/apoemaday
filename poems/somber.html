                There is nothing colder
                Than the dawn air that bites
                When I roll over
                And reach out to nothing
              
                There's nothing more somber
                Than when I find
                That you're no longer
                Lying by my side
              
                I am alone
                Life is only pain
                There's nothing but the grind
                There is only sadness
                And-- oh, you're back from downstairs, nevermind.
