             "Somber"

There is nothing colder
Than the dawn air that bites
When I roll over
And reach out to nothing

There's nothing more somber
Than when I find
That you're no longer
Lying by my side

I am alone
Life is only pain
There's nothing but the grind
There is only sadness
And-- oh, you're back from downstairs, nevermind.
