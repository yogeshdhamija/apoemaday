             "The Next Day"

Woe is me, for I am done
The home is warm, the songs are sung
The food is et, and I am lulled
Seeing in your eyes, the sunset

I curse each moment for passing
Joy must be heavier than sorrow
For sorrow makes days feel longer
But it has just skipped away

I'd stand at the gates of Chronus
And force from him a pause
But time flows by like the sand
and I'd miss you nonetheless

I've accepted my fate
Oh, what a dream you were!

To my surprise, I awaken to you
Still there, still real, my valentine
And I see in your eyes, the sunrise.
